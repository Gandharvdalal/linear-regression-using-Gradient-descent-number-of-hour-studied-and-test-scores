# linear-regression-using-Gradient-descent-number-of-hour-studied-and-test-scores
This is the code for the "How to Do Linear Regression the Right Way"
Overview
I'm using a small dataset of student test scores and the amount of hours they studied. Intuitively, there must be a relationship right? The more you study, the better your test scores should be. We're going to use linear regression to prove this relationship.

Here are some helpful links:

Dependencies
numpy
Python 2 and 3 both work for this. Use pip to install any dependencies.

Usage
here i am using jupter notebook for code. which consist all the dependencies pre installed


Running...
After 1000 iterations b = 0.10148121494753724, m = 1.4796491688889395
